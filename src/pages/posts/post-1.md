## Selling vs Investing Time
As of today on any given regular weekday I sell 1 hour of my time for 24€ pre tax.  For my 7 1/2 hour workday that means 180€, for my 5 day workweek that comes down to 900€ and again these figures are pre tax. I want to aknowledge first and formost that I have it quite good compared to a lot of other people, but that doesn't mean I am happy with how things are. The main thing that bothers me is the selling of my time, the fact that on any regular weekday I am not in controll of 7 1/2 of my day is annoying. 


# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2022-07-01

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
